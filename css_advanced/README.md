# CSS Advanced Project

This project focuses on applying advanced CSS concepts to build a responsive and visually appealing webpage. Based on a Figma design, I implemented styles for the header, banner, quote section, videos, membership, FAQ, and footer using only HTML and CSS.

## Objectives
- Understand and apply CSS specificity
- Use CSS selectors effectively
- Implement box model properties
- Recreate a web layout from a Figma design
